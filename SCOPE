# Objective

The goal of this repository is to provide a useful collection of code
samples or "snippets" that can be modified slightly to perform a single
discrete function or purpose.  If you've ever written source code using
documentation as a reference, you know how difficult it can be sometimes
to convert documentation, such as the boto3 reference, into functional
code.  This repository aims to increase agility by shortening the gap
between a conceptual application idea and a prototype or proof of concept,
by providing code "snippets" that can be used as a starter for any
application, to enable rapid prototyping and increase agility.

This repository should contain:

-	Code samples that are designed to demonstrate how to perform a single,
	discrete function. An example would be: adding an item to a DynamoDB
	table.
-	CloudFormation template samples that are designed to provision a single,
	discrete resource in AWS, or multiple resources that perform a single
	discrete function. An example would be: An Elastic MapReduce cluster
	that uses Spot Fleets.
-	IAM template samples that are designed to configure identity or
	resource-based permissions.
-	Useful shell scripts and other "one-liners" designed to help manage
	AWS resources.
-	Skeleton code that is useful as a starter to build a microservice.

This repository does not contain:

-	Code that comprises a complete application.
-	Code samples that, combined together, create a complete application.
-	Code that does not meet a high quality standard.  The goal is to ensure
	that all code snippets follow best practices, and are of sufficient
	quality that they should not require significant modification or
	refactoring for production use.
-	Code that requires the use of deprecated APIs, services, or features.
